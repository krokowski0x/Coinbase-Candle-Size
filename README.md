# Coinbase Candle Size Indicator

This project aims to add popular Candle Size Indicator utility to [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) via Chrome extension.

## Brief description

GDAX was great and now (July 2018) it became [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/). And the name seems to be all that has changed. Unfortunately, all the technical stuff there is on Coinbase is the ability to look at candles instead of useless line chart. **Too bad**. If it had most of [Trading View](https://tradingview.com) functionality, it would be unstoppable. But as a developer working on the same stack as they do and a trader-to-be, I'd like to make my contribution to the platform. So here it is. **Still work in progress though**.

## Additional info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
